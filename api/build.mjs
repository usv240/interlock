/**
 * Bundle the Lambda into a single ESM file.
 *
 * Bundling rather than zipping node_modules keeps the artifact small (cold
 * starts matter for a demo a judge clicks once) and makes the deployed code
 * exactly reviewable — one file, no transitive surprises.
 *
 * The AWS SDK is left external: the nodejs22.x runtime already ships v3, so
 * bundling it would add megabytes to download on every cold start for no gain.
 *
 * Run: npm run api:build
