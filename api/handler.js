 *   GET  /v1/health          preflight: topology, survival goal, quota left
 *   POST /v1/demo            run a scripted conflict end to end, return the trace
 *   POST /v1/intents         declare an intent before acting
 *   POST /v1/commits         commit a change; returns rulings on anyone threatened
 *   GET  /v1/adjudications   recent rulings (read-only audit feed)
 *
 * SPENDING SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY
 * This endpoint is unauthenticated so judges and passers-by can try it, which
 * means strangers can spend our inference budget. Per-instance rate limiting
 * would not help: Lambda instances are ephemeral and concurrent, so in-memory
 * counters undercount by exactly the factor that matters during a flood.
 *
 * So the ceiling lives in the database, incremented inside a SERIALIZABLE
 * transaction. It is the same guarantee this product exists to provide, turned
 * on its own operating costs -- which felt like the honest way to build it.

 * calls and $5 a day. Nothing ever checked the sum. `recordSpend` has always
 * written a `global` row and /v1/health has always displayed it, which made it
 * look supervised; nothing read it back to refuse anything. Twenty tenants
 * could spend $100 in a day, and the honest answer to "what stops that" was
 * "nobody has signed up yet".
 *
 * That is exactly the failure this project is about: a check that appears to
 * exist, reads as authoritative, and never fires.
 *
 * Read-only and outside the reservation, deliberately. Spend is recorded after
 * a call completes, so the global figure always lags by one request — trying to
 * make it exact would mean reserving an estimate before knowing the cost. The
