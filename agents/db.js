/**
 * Database access for the INTERLOCK runtime.
 *
 * Two things here are deliberate rather than incidental:
 *
 * 1. `serializableTx` retries on 40001. CockroachDB runs SERIALIZABLE by
 *    default, which means the database will refuse an interleaving it cannot
 *    order — and it signals that by aborting one of the transactions. Retrying
 *    is not a workaround; it is how you cash in the guarantee. A system that
 *    claims lost updates are impossible has to actually handle the abort that
 *    makes them impossible.
 *
 * 2. Every connection sets `application_name`, so a slow query in the
 *    CockroachDB console can be traced back to the component that issued it.
