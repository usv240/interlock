/**
 * Two agents, one queue, the same collision — priced with and without INTERLOCK.
 *
 * Built for a live walkthrough: it runs through the public API with your own
 * key, in about fifteen seconds, and every INTERLOCK figure it prints is
 * measured on the spot.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS ASSUMED
 * This is the part that has to stay honest, because the whole argument collapses
 * if the comparison is rigged.
 *
 *   MEASURED, live, this run:
 *     - whether the conflict is detected at all, and by which path
 *     - the verdict, and exactly which plan steps it invalidates
 *     - the tokens and dollars the adjudication itself cost
 *
 *   ASSUMED, and stated on screen:
 *     - how many tokens the agent spent reasoning before it was interrupted
 *
 * That last number is a parameter because it is a property of *your* agent, not
 * of this service — we never see your reasoning. It is also the number the whole
 * result hinges on, so `--reasoning` changes it, and the script prints the
 * break-even point rather than hiding it.
 *
 *   npm run compare -- ilk_your_key
 *   npm run compare -- ilk_your_key --reasoning 3000    # below break-even
 *
 * Below break-even INTERLOCK costs MORE and this script says so in as many
 * words. A demo that can only produce good news is not evidence.
