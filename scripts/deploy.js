/**
 * Build, upload and invalidate — one command.
 *
 * The demo has to stay reachable from submission until judging closes, weeks
 * later. Making redeployment a single reproducible command is what keeps that
 * true: a deploy that takes six remembered steps is a deploy that eventually
 * gets done wrong at 1am.
 *
 * Cache strategy: hashed assets under _next/static are immutable and cached for
 * a year; HTML is cached briefly and invalidated on every deploy. Without the
 * split, either the HTML goes stale or the CDN loses its point.
 *
 * Run: npm run deploy
