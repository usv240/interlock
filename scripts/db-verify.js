/**
 * Proves the four claims the project rests on, against the live cluster.
 *
 * Every one of these is something the landing page asserts, so each should be
 * reproducible by anyone who clones the repo rather than taken on trust:
 *
 *   1. Isolation really is SERIALIZABLE (inherited, not implemented)
 *   2. The database is multi-region and survives losing a region
 *   3. AS OF SYSTEM TIME reads real historical rows — not just constants
 *   4. The C-SPANN vector index is actually chosen by the planner
 *
 * Run: npm run db:verify
